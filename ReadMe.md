## A Cassette 50 Compo Game ##

This is a 2K ($0801-$1000) memory game.
Written entirely over on my Twitch stream during 2020 for the Cassette 50 Games Charity competition.

The game is simple, just fly thru the cavern bombing rockets, ships and fuel dumps, try and avoid the rockets launched at you :)

Be Prepared, this is a typical Cassette 50 game.... and so is almost impossible to play LOL. Good Luck, you will need it.

The goal is to score as high as possible for the fuel you have.

Joystick controls:
```
Up = Up, 
Down = Down, 
Right = Forward, 
Left = Bomb and 
fire = fire (of course lol)
```
